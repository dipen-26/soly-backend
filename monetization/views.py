monetization/views.py

This module defines API views for monetization features, including subscriptions, points, rewards, donations, revenue sharing, transactions, and payouts.
Views handle HTTP requests, interact with models and serializers, and implement custom logic for ML analysis, fraud detection, and financial workflows.

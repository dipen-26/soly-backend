"""
Views for the Analytics app of Soly - Live Streaming Platform.

This module defines DRF ViewSets for all analytics-related models, enabling RESTful API access for analytics, highlights, insights, ML models, and content analysis.

Workflows:
- Each ViewSet provides CRUD operations for its model via API endpoints.
- Permissions are set to require authentication for all analytics operations.
- ML/DL stubs are included for future integration of advanced logic.

Layman explanation:
- These classes let you interact with analytics data over the web (API), so you can create, read, update, or delete analytics records, highlights, insights, ML models, and content analysis results.
- You must be logged in to use these endpoints.
